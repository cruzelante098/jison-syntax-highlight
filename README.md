# Jison Syntax Highlight support for VS Code

This extension brings syntax highlight for Jison grammars files in VS Code. It's a fork from the Atom extension (also used by Github Linguist), created by Chris Dibbern (<https://github.com/cdibbs>). Jison is a parser generator quite similar to Bison, but it uses Javascript (and also generates parsers written in JS) instead of C or C++.

## Features

Just one: syntax highlighting.

## Requirements

Nothing in special.

## Extension Settings

None.

## Known Issues

GOTO [issues section in the repo](<https://github.com/cruzelante098/jison-syntax-highlight/issues>).
